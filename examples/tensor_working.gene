# For now, due to a bug with native functions in file execution,
# we demonstrate the tensor functionality using the eval command

# Test basic tensor creation
(println "Tensor operations would work with:")
(println "  (tensor/create [2 3]) - Create a 2x3 tensor")
(println "  (tensor/zeros [4 4]) - Create a 4x4 zero tensor")
(println "  (tensor/random [5 5]) - Create a 5x5 random tensor")

# The functions are available:
(println "tensor namespace:" tensor)
(println "tensor/create function:" tensor/create)
(println)

# But there's currently a bug where native functions return 1 when called from files
# This works correctly in eval mode:
