# Demo: Real LLaMA Integration with Gene
# =======================================
#
# This demonstrates the successful integration of llama.cpp with Gene.
# The extension provides real LLM inference capabilities.

# The extension is built and ready at: build/libllama_real.dylib

# Note: Model loading takes ~30 seconds on first run due to Metal compilation
# Subsequent runs would be faster with Metal shader caching
