## 💻 Code Examples

### Simple Tensor Operations
```gene
(var a (tensor/create [2 3] :float32))
(var b (tensor/create [3 2] :float32))
(var c (tensor/matmul a b))  ; Results in 2x2 tensor
(println c)  ; <Tensor shape=[2, 2] dtype=float32 device=cpu>
```

### Neural Network Layer
```gene
(fn linear-layer [input weights bias]
  (tensor/add (tensor/matmul input weights) bias))

(var output (linear-layer input w1 b1))
```

### Model Inference (Future)
```gene
(var model (model/load "llama-7b.gguf"))
(var tokens (tokenizer/encode "Hello world"))
(var output (model/forward model tokens))
```

## 🎉 Impact

Gene now has:
1. **Native AI Support**: Tensors are built into the language, not bolted on
2. **Interoperability**: Can leverage both C and Python ML ecosystems
3. **Performance Potential**: VM-based approach enables future optimizations
4. **Clean Syntax**: Lisp-like syntax natural for model composition
5. **Type Safety**: Prevents common ML programming errors
