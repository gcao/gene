# Performance Comparison: Fibonacci(24)

## Benchmark Results

Testing recursive fibonacci(24) which makes 150,049 function calls total.

### Important Finding: No Caching
None of the tested languages (Ruby, Python, Node.js, Gene) implement automatic memoization or caching for recursive calls. All make the full 150,049 function calls for fib(24).

| Language | Time (seconds) | Calls/second | Relative Speed |
|----------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Node.js  | 0.001         | 150,049,000  | 245x           |
| Ruby     | 0.004         | 35,074,800   | 57x            |
| Python   | 0.006         | 25,138,012   | 41x            |
| Gene VM  | 0.245         | 611,694      | 1x (baseline)  |

## Analysis

Gene VM is currently **57x slower than Ruby** and **41x slower than Python** for this recursive benchmark. This is expected given:

1. **Interpreted VM overhead**: Gene uses a bytecode VM while Ruby/Python have heavily optimized VMs
2. **No JIT compilation**: Unlike modern JavaScript engines, Gene doesn't have JIT
3. **Memory allocation**: Gene allocates frames and values more frequently
4. **Type checking overhead**: Dynamic dispatch adds overhead

## Context

- **Ruby**: MRI (CRuby) with decades of optimization
- **Python**: CPython with extensive C optimizations
- **Node.js**: V8 engine with JIT compilation
- **Gene**: Young VM implementation focused on correctness first

## Future Optimizations

Based on profiling, the following optimizations could significantly improve performance:

1. **Frame pooling**: Reduce allocation overhead (potential 20-30% improvement)
2. **Inline caching**: Cache method lookups (potential 15-20% improvement)
3. **Specialized instructions**: Add optimized opcodes for common operations
4. **NaN-boxing optimization**: Better utilize the tagged pointer approach
5. **Tail call optimization**: Eliminate stack frames for tail calls

With these optimizations, Gene could potentially reach 1-2M calls/second, bringing it closer to Python's performance level.
