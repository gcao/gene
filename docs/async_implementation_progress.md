# Async/Await Implementation Progress

## Summary

We have made significant progress implementing async/await support in the Gene VM:

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Basic async/await operators**
   - Added `IkAsync` and `IkAwait` instructions to the VM
   - Implemented compilation for `(async expr)` and `(await future)`
   - Basic tests for `(async 1)` and `(await (async 1))` are passing

2. **Future type infrastructure**
   - Added `VkFuture` to ValueKind enum
   - Created `FutureObj` type with state management (pending/success/failure)
   - Added `future_class` to Application
   - Fixed `get_class` to support VkFuture

3. **Future value creation**
   - Implemented `new_future()` and `new_future_value()` functions
   - Added `complete()` and `fail()` methods to FutureObj
   - Basic state management works

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

1. **Exception handling in async blocks**
   - Currently `(async (throw))` throws immediately instead of capturing in future
   - Need to wrap async body execution in try/catch

2. **Future class methods**
   - Constructor: `(new gene/Future)`
   - Instance methods: `.complete()`, `.fail()`, `.on_success()`, `.on_failure()`
   - These require implementing method dispatch for Future instances

3. **Async function attribute**
   - `^^async` attribute should make functions return futures automatically
   - Not yet implemented in the compiler

4. **Advanced features**
   - `$await_all` for waiting on multiple futures
   - Real async operations (sleep_async, etc.)
   - Integration with Nim's asyncdispatch

## Test Results

Out of the async tests:
- ‚úÖ 4 tests passing (basic async/await)
- ‚ùå 7 tests failing (require Future methods or exception handling)
- üî∏ Many tests commented out (require Future constructor)

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper exception handling in IkAsync
2. Add Future constructor support
3. Implement Future instance methods
4. Add ^^async function attribute support

The foundation is in place, but more work is needed for full async support.
