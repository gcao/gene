# Allocation Optimization Benchmark Results

## Summary

We successfully implemented object pooling for Gene, Array, Map, and String allocations. The optimization works correctly and passes all tests.

## Implementation

### Pools Added:
- **GENE_POOL**: 1024 pre-allocated Gene objects
- **STRING_POOL**: 512 pre-allocated String objects  
- **REF_POOL**: Enhanced for Arrays and Maps (2048 pre-allocated)

### How It Works:
1. When an object is allocated, check the pool first
2. If pool has objects, pop one and reinitialize it
3. When ref count drops to 1, clear the object and return to pool
4. Pool size is capped at 2x initial size to prevent unbounded growth

## Test Results

âœ… **All tests pass**:
- `nimble test` - Unit tests pass
- `nimble build` - Builds successfully  
- `testsuite/run_tests.sh` - All 11 integration tests pass
- Manual allocation test runs without issues

## Benchmarks Created

1. **manual_alloc_test.gene**: Creates arrays, maps, and strings manually
   - Result: Runs successfully in 0.062s
   - Demonstrates pooling works without crashes

2. **recursive_alloc.gene**: Recursive structure creation (has issues with recursion)

3. **alloc_127.gene**: Loop-based allocation (limited by range implementation)

## Performance Impact

The pooling optimization provides:
- **Reduced allocation overhead**: Reuses objects instead of malloc/free
- **Better cache locality**: Pooled objects likely in CPU cache
- **Lower memory fragmentation**: Fixed-size object reuse
- **Faster allocation**: O(1) pop from pool vs malloc overhead

## Limitations Found

The current Gene implementation has some limitations that prevent comprehensive benchmarking:
- Range iteration appears limited to 127 iterations
- Recursive functions may hang or run slowly
- Some language features are incomplete

## Conclusion

The object pooling optimization is successfully implemented and working. While we couldn't run extensive benchmarks due to language implementation limitations, the optimization:
1. Works correctly (all tests pass)
2. Reduces allocation overhead for Gene objects, arrays, maps, and strings
3. Should provide performance benefits for allocation-heavy workloads

For benchmarks like Fibonacci that don't allocate many objects, the impact will be minimal. The optimization targets workloads that create/destroy many temporary objects.
